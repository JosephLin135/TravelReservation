## Travel Reservation System

This system is a Java-based application that enables users to book, cancel, and manage travel reservations. The system can manage multiple types of reservations and allows users and admins to validate inputs and ensure that all scheduling is proper and no conflicts occur.

This project was developed to practice object-oriented programming, data structures, and system validation using Java.
